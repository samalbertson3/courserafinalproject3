# courserafinalproject3
Final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data class on Coursera

Working with data provided in the project instructions from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

The output.txt file contains data on the mean and standard deviation of accelerometer data from the given dataset on the XYZ axes, sorted by subject number and the type of activity being performed by the subject.

Variables in output.txt are:
  - subject_labels: Number assigned to the specific test subject performing the experiment. Ranges from 1 to 30.
  - activity_labels: Type of activity being performed. Includes:
    - WALKING
    - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    - SITTING
    - STANDING
    - LAYING
  - Xmean: Mean of accelerometer readings on X axis.
  - Ymean: Mean of accelerometer readings on Y axis.
  - Zmean: Mean of accelerometer readings on Z axis.
  - Xstd: Standard deviation of accelerometer readings on X axis.
  - Ystd: Standard deviation of accelerometer readings on Y axis.
  - Zstd: Standard deviation of accelerometer readings on Z axis.
